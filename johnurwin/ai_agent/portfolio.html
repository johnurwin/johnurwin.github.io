                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a seasoned data professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. My technical skills include proficiency in Python, SQL, Tableau, and AWS QuickSight, enabling me to develop robust ETL processes and predictive models such as ARIMA and exponential decay models. With experience in Big Data analytics and tools like SAS Viya and R, I have successfully deployed various data projects, including churn prediction models and custom ESG portfolios.

Throughout my career, I have excelled in collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful insights and solutions. My expertise extends to strategic thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication, which have been instrumental in leading projects like the Source of Truth pricing pipeline and the Cleveland Clinic Predictive Cost model. Leveraging my educational background in finance and economics, along with a Master's in Management, I have honed my skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, and presenting complex findings to stakeholders.

Currently serving as a Business Intelligence Engineer at Amazon, I continue to drive innovation through data-driven decision-making and leveraging tools like AWS Redshift and the Shapley Method. My portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects, from marketing dashboards to operating room time prediction models, demonstrating my versatility and expertise in leveraging data to solve complex business challenges.</p>
